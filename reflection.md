Abby McIlraith and Michelle Lawson are german scientists building a pirated version of a certain Swedish game that cannot be accessed in our country. We implement the Contract interface created by Jordan Crouser.

<h3>Brainstorming Ideas:</h3>

    attributes?
    - game inventory -> hashTable < String itemName, int numAvailable >
        - content : hashTable
        - capacity - do we really want it?
    - coordinates for location - arr  int [x, y, z]
    - size String [tiny, small, medium, large, giant]
    - Boolean awake [either awake or asleep T/F]

    methods
    - grab from inventory
    - drop item in inventory
    - examine [turn left, turn right, turn front, turn to back (all print "You have turned this to the ___")]
    - use - deduct from inventory
    - walk - change coordinates (adds/subtracts x,y)
    - fly - changes to 1, changes x,y accordingly, changes z back to 0
    - shrink change size (with limitations)
    - grow chanvfjedfvbjrfbd yeah
    - rest change awake status
    -undo (unRest!)? print "previous action undone!"

Process:
